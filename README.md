- Customize the **timer, effect pool, and team mode** to tailor the chaos!

## ❌ Curses (Bad Effects)  
These effects **make survival more difficult** and force players to adapt!  

- **"Slippery Hands"** – Randomly drop items from your hotbar.  
- **"Paper Legs"** – Fall damage is tripled.  
- **"Boom Boots"** – Every time you jump, you cause a small explosion.  
- **"Flashlight Mode"** – You can only see in a tiny circle around you.  
- **"Chicken Mode"** – You can’t stop jumping.  
- **"Fragile Tools"** – Every tool loses **double durability**.  
- **"Nocturnal Fear"** – Mobs **aggressively** target you at night.

## ✨ Blessings (Good Effects)  
Not everything is bad—some effects **help you** (but only for a while)!  

- **"God Mode (Kinda)"** – You take no damage for 30 seconds.  
- **"Sticky Fingers"** – Mobs drop **double loot** for 5 minutes.  
- **"Feather Fall"** – No fall damage, but you fall super slowly.  
- **"Hulk Smash"** – Punching mobs does as much damage as a diamond sword.  
- **"Boat Mode"** – Walk on water as if it’s ice.  
- **"Speedster"** – Permanent Speed II effect until the next roulette spin.  
- **"Golden Appetite"** – Eating restores **double hunger**.
